    "In IDS, we use DFS algorithm with limited depth and use an iterative approach to check several depth to find the goal state. Frontier set acts like a LIFO queue and in each step, we'll expand the deepest state in the frontier set and add the state and its current depth to the explored set, which is used to avoid duplicate checking for states. Pay attention! We'll add a duplicate state if current depth is less than previously seen depth(since a new path is found with less shorter length). We'll reset these sets if we couldn't find a path in a specific depth. We'll keep track of total states checked and traversal tree during execution of algorithm."

    "The idea behind this algorithm is to estimate remaining cost from each state to goal state and then in each step, try to expand the node with smallest overall cost(cost to get to state + estimated remaining cost to goal state). We call this estimation, the heuristic function for A* algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we define heuristic function as follows(we use Manhattan distance for our function):\n",
    "- If there are no fellows remained in current state, heuristic function is distance from current cell to goal cell.\n",
    "- If Gandalf carries a fellow, heuristic function is distance from (current cell to fellow's destination) + (fellows's destination to goal cell)\n",
    "- If Gandalf carries no one, heuristic function is minimum value for (distance from (current cell to fellows' starting cell) + (fellows' starting cell to fellows' destination) + (fellows' destination to goal cell))\n",
    "\n",
    "A good heuristic function is a function that doesn't overestimate paths' costs. This property is known as admissiblity and consistency. An admissible heuristic's estimation for each state is less or equal to true cost to reach goal from that state. In a consistent heuristic, this inequality holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cost(A to C) \\geq h(A) - h(C)$$, where A and C are two states.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, our heuristic function doesn't overestimate costs(since in each state, the minimum true cost is what our function estimates and thus, this function is admissible. It's easy to show that heuristic function is consistent too. We show check inquality mentioned above for each two possible neighbour states. For example, if we are at a state with some remaining fellows(A) and its neighbour state is a state in which Gandalf picks up a fellow(C), since h(A) is less than/equal to h(B) + cost of path between them(because of the definition mentioned above), the inequality holds. For other conditions, we can simply show that the inequality holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's implement this algorithm. There is a challenge in implementing this algorithm: We need a data structure to store open states to get the minimum f value(f = g(current cost) + h) in optimal time, which is usually implemented using priority queue, but in algorithm, if we see a duplicate state with less g value than observed before, we should update our data structure for this state(since a better path is found) but random access in priority queue is expensive. Here we used a dictionary for our open list and a set for closed list and in each step, we find min by iterating over our open list. Consumed time in this implementation is a bit better than implementing open list with min heap and update heap by iterating over open list. There is a trade-off between time for getting minimum state and time for updating state in open list. Here is the implementation: "

    "- It's complete(assuming number of nodes with f(n) <= C* is finite).\n",
    "- It's optimal(since cost is 1 per step).\n",
    "- This is the best one of all the other algorithms if we choose a good heuristic..\n",

    "\n",
    "## Cons\n",
    "- The speed execution of A* search is highly dependant on the accuracy of the heuristic algorithm that is used to compute h(n) and implementation and is a bit slower than algorithms like BFS.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Weighted A*\n",
    "Sometimes we need to find a path in less time spent and optimality is not a big deal for us. We will use a weight for heuristic function to visit less states. Pay attention! Using high weights will increase the time! There are domains where a larger weight leads to a slower search. Here are the records for two different weights:"
